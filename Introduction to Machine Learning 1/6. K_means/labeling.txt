Data Labeling and Neocolonialism in the AI Industry
When people think of artificial intelligence, the image is most likely Silicon Valley engineers earning good salaries and status. However, a significant portion of the AI sector is based on an invisible workforce of data labelers in Africa. According to the report by TIME, Kenyan employees have been contracted to label the toxic materials to make models like ChatGPT appear less harmful to its users (Perrigo, 2023). By examining these practices through the notion of neocolonialism, there¡¯s a distinct connection between digital labor markets and the traditional ones in terms of exploitation.
Neocolonialism is the concept of the indirect dominance of less developed nations by the developed countries via the economic dependence and the control of corporations instead of the direct colonial occupation (Halperin and Sandra, 2014). It continues the colonial style of exploitation by harnessing world capitalism to preserve inequalities. The Kenya case is similar, where workers received payment as low as $1.32 to $2 per hour to process violent and sexual content whereas OpenAI in San Francisco worthing billions of dollars. The disparity reminds of colonial extraction, in which vast value is concentrated in the North whereas the South provide cheap and hazardous labor.
This dynamic is reinforced by mechanisms of dependency. Silicon Valley companies have various options regarding contractors, but Kenyan employees have few options and take risky jobs for a living. Their role is subordinate in structure, since they take the psychological pains of labeling the traumatic content but receive little portion of profits. Simultaneously, the outsourcing firms were selling the job as a form of poverty eradication, hiding the effect on the psychological health of the employees. This rhetorical strategy is close to traditional neocolonial mechanisms when they exploit people and support using disguise of development or collaboration.
Nonetheless, some differences can be observed. Traditional neocolonialism was usually characterized by implementation of structural adjustment or trade imbalance by the nations, states or financial institutions. Conversely, data labeling is arranged by commercial companies, the contracts of which are formally voluntary. However, the unequal nature of the bargaining power recreates a familiar dependency: the technological innovations of the North are supported by labor in the South being underpaid. These economic asymmetries does not denied the fact that they are colonial in nature due to the lack of formal state control.
The Kenyan example demonstrates that behind the narrative of automated intelligence lies hidden human effort, echoing Kwame Nkrumah¡¯s warning that neocolonialism represents ¡°the last stage of imperialism.¡± To move beyond digital neocolonialism, firms must be pressed to provide living wages, strong mental health protection, and transparency about the labor enabling AI. Without such reforms, the industry risks reproducing hierarchies of exploitation under the guise of innovation.
The example of Kenya shows that behind automated intelligence, there is much human effort, which suggests that neocolonialism is ¡°the last stage of imperialism¡±. To get out of digital neocolonialism, companies should be obliged to offer living wages, good mental health protection, and disclosure of the labor facilitating AI. Without such reforms, the industry would easily fall into reproducing hierarchies of exploitation in the name of innovation.
