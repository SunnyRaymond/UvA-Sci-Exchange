    "# Chatbots: ELIZA\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first assignment we'll take a look at some simple chatbots, and their sometimes seemingly human responses. We'll start with a demo of ELIZA, a chatbot created in the 60's by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT. It was created to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between humans and machines, but Weizenbaum was surprised by the number of individuals who attributed humanlike feelings to the computer program. ELIZA is considered one of the first programs capable of attempting the Turing test.\n",

One of the conditions for a pass for the assignment is therefore that this cell and the cells below are all run without errors. If you do get an error, first make sure you've installed the `minai` environment correctly, as per the installation instructions.*"
